    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate which group of vulnerable populations in New York City have worse accessibility to public parks in a quantitative approach. The contribution of this thesis is the evaluation of New York City parks in quantitative ways through accessibility through accessible park area per capita or average park crime rate. This thesis chooses tax lots as the analysis geo unit of parks and people. The quantitative study will be done by The Cadastral-Based Expert Dasymetric System method, Network analysis, two-step floating catchment area method, Regression method, etc. The expected results are supposed to show which vulnerable neighborhoods or groups of people are supposed to be allocated more resources to improve the equity of public parks in New York City. </p>
    <p>Keywords: parks, Park area per capita, 2 Step Floating Catchment Area method, environmental justice, vulnerable population.</p>

    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Background </h3>
    <p>Cities have always been the most important places for people to work and live. And many essential infrastructures and public services are provided to support people’s lives, including public parks. Public parks are vitally important to ensuring citizens’ physical and mental well-being, reducing the negative impact of natural disasters, protecting the environment, contributing to the economy of a region, etc. But within cities, green space is not always equitably distributed. Access is often highly stratified based on income, ethno-racial characteristics, age, gender, (dis)ability, and other axes of difference (Wolch, Byrne and Newell 2014). Such disparities in park accessibility across the city prevent people from enjoying the benefits of parks equitably. This thesis would like to figure out the disparities of public parks in New York City.</p>
    <h3>Research Question</h3>
    <p>Whether accessibility to public parks in New York City is equitable across different groups of people with varying demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.</p>
    <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
    <p>Nowadays, many people pay attention to environmental justice problems. Many planners focus on the accessibility to public parks of vulnerable populations, such as people of color, the elderly, low-income, and non-English speaking households. This thesis aims to evaluate which group of vulnerable populations in New York City have worse accessibility to public parks in a quantitative approach.</p>
    <h3>Value of research</h3>
    <p>1) This research will reveal which group of people has lack accessibility to public parks in a quantitative approach.</p>
    <p>Many articles state there is inequity among vulnerable populations, like races, older, disabilities. OneNYC 2050 (de Blasio 2015) mentioned that vibrant public spaces are one of the opportunities for well-being, and essentials for people to engage with each other, exercise, and play. But the history of racial residential segregation has led to startling health inequities experienced most by neighborhoods that lack opportunities for well-being. United Nations’ 11.7 targets of Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations 2016) which states that sustainable development must “provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities”. However, although the importance of public parks has been emphasized. researches of New York City in the past contain analyses of some flaws of the inequity problem in quantitative and qualitative aspects. Thus, this research focuses on New York City and ensures which group of people lacks accessibility to public parks. </p>
    <p>2) This research will put forward recommendations of parks distribution in the future to improve the equity of New York City.</p>
    <p>After knowing which group of people has worse accessibility, this thesis will analyze which vulnerable neighborhoods or groups of people are supposed to be allocated more resources to improve the equity of public parks in New York City. </p>
